		<h4>an Eating Disorder Documentary</h4>
		<p>From award winning producer, Lew Goldstein, and recently recovered eating disorder survivor and television host, Kari Adams, this film features candid stories about eating disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, addiction and self harm. Director of Photography and YouTube Pulitzer Award winner Mark Jeevaratnam captures intimate interviews with girls, women and men who have suffered from or are currently struggling with eating disorders, addiction or self harm.</p>

		<p>We are working closely in conjunction with New Jersey Assemblyman <a href="http://www.reedgusciora.com/" target="_blank">Reed Gusciora</a> to introduce a bill to congress to mandate that all New Jersey Public Schools include eating disorder education in their curriculum as well as train educational staff members. We are starting with New Jersey and plan to take this initiative to a national level. We need support and funding for this important documentary that will coincide with the bill and be included as required viewing as a part of the eating disorder instruction.</p>

		<p>Our goal with this documentary is two fold: 1) To deter young people from turning to an eating disorder to manage their feelings and emotions and 2) To show those suffering from eating disorders, low self-esteem, self harm and body dysmorphia that recovery IS possible.</p>

		<p>**For EVERY dollar raised for the funding of this film, a portion will be donated to the <a href="http://freedfoundation.org/" taget="_blank">FREED Foundation</a>, an organization that helps to raise funds to assist eating disorder sufferers receive treatment if they can't afford it on their own and/or their insurance carriers won't cover them.</p>

		<p>If you or someone you know suffers from this harmful and insidious disease, please give to this worthy cause that is inspired to help spread awareness about eating disorders and negative body image.</p>

		<p>CAST MEMBERS: We are mostly filming everyday people who are either currently suffering from an eating disorder or who have recently recovered. We also have some well-known names who will be appearing in the film such as Brian Cuban, brother of basketball's Mavericks Team Owner and co-host of ABC's Shark Tank Mark Cuban, and other well known people in the eating disorder industry.</p>

		<p>In conjunction with interviews, it is our goal to follow 1 or 2 people who are currently suffering from an eating disorder and show their progress through the recovery process.  Unlike most documentaries about eating disorders, we will show a positive ending with folks recovering and talking about their healing process.  While we want to discourage young kids from developing an eating disorder, we also want to demonstrate that recovery from one is entirely possible.</p>

    <blockquote>
    **PLEASE NOTE: No showing of numbers, such as weight, calories or clothing sizes will be included in this documentary. From her own experience, Kari knows too well the triggering effects of showing impressionable images of dangerously thin people in movies, magazines and ads. It is our belief that young people, as well as adults, are bombarded as it is with too many images and messages of what "ideal beauty" is and we, plain and simple, will not partake in the exploitation of them.</blockquote>
